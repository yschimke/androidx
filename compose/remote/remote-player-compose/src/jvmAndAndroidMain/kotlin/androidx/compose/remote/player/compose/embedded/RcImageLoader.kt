/**
 * Pluggable image loader so the embedded player doesn't depend on any specific image-loading library.
 *
 * The player resolves a document image reference (a `BitmapData` id) to a Compose [Painter] through
 * this interface. The default ([EmbeddedRcImageLoader]) wraps the document's embedded, already-decoded
 * bitmaps; a host can supply its own loader — backed by Coil, Glide, a disk cache, etc. — to resolve
 * ids the document doesn't carry pixels for (e.g. a host-substituted or remotely-fetched image).
 *
 * [loadImage] returns a [State] rather than a plain value so the result works in both worlds:
 * - in a `@Composable` (the `Image` recomposes when an asynchronously-loaded painter arrives), and
 * - on the canvas draw path, read imperatively via `state.value`.
 *
 * Implementations must return a **stable** [State] for a given [bitmapId] (cache per id) so the
 * composable and the canvas observe the same value, and so an async completion updates both.
 *
 * Using a Compose [Painter] (rather than an Android `Drawable`) keeps this multiplatform: the android
 * player can wrap a host `Drawable` via `DrawablePainter`, and the desktop player uses Skia-backed
 * painters directly.
